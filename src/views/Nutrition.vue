    <h1>How Many Calories Should I Eat in a Day?</h1>

    <p>
      Eating a certain number of calories per day can help you achieve and
      maintain a healthy weight. Research further indicates that, when following
      a balanced diet, consuming the best number of calories for you can also
      help improve your health and boost longevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When determining how many calories you should eat per day, it helps to
      first understand the established recommended calorie intakes. From there,
      you can consider other factors to find the calorie intake that is right
      for you given your body and health-related goals.
    </p>
    <h2>Recommended Calorie Intakes</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing the recommended calorie intake guidelines can provide a better
      idea of what your calorie range will be. These vary based on whether you
      are an adult, a teen, or a child.
    </p>
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <p>
      The recommended calorie intake for adult women ranges from 1,600 calories
      per day to 2,400 calories per day. For men, the amount is slightly higher,
      ranging from 2,200 to 3,200 calories per day.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are somewhat sedentary or older, your calorie needs are likely
      toward the bottom of the range. If you are fairly physically active,
      pregnant, or breastfeeding, you may be closer to the top.
    </p>
    <h3>Teens</h3>
    <p>
      Calorie intake recommendations for teens vary based on age, sex, and
      activity level. A 13-year-old girl's recommended intake ranges from 1,600
      to 2,200 calories daily with a 2,000 to 2,600 recommended intake for a
      13-year-old boy
    </p>
    <p>
      These amounts increase slightly in the later teen years. For girls aged 14
      to 18, the range is 1,800 calories per day to 2,400. For boys in this same
      age range, the recommended calorie intake is somewhere between 2,000 and
      3,200 calories.
    </p>

    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>
      Children between the ages of 2 and 3 years old need between 1,000 and
      1,400 calories per day. Where they fall in this range depends on how
      active they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 4 to 8 years of age, the range starts at 1,200 calories daily and
      increases to 1,800 calories for girls and 2,000 calories for boys. At 9 to
      13 years, the calorie range is 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day for girls
      and 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily for boys.2
    </p>
    <h2>Factors That Affect Your Target Calorie Intake</h2>
    <p>
      As the recommended calorie intake guidelines suggest, the number of
      calories you need per day can vary based on a variety of factors. Among
      them are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="justify-center">Sex</li>
      <li>Height</li>
      <li>Weight</li>
      <li>Age</li>
      <li>Activity level</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additional factors that can affect how many calories your body uses for
      energy, thus also impacting how many you should consume, include your
      hormones,5 some medications (such as steroids and some diabetes
      medicines),6 and your overall health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nutrition Facts label on foods provides information based on a 2,000
      calorie per day diet. But people can have different calorie needs.
      Determining your individual needs can help you maintain a healthy weight.
